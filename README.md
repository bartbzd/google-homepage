Remade the Google homepage as a project to learn about the basics of positioning and styling with HTML & CSS. 

Utilizing my learning from The Odin Project, their Foundations of HTML & CSS section, as well as FreeCodeCamp, Responsive Design basics, I had the opportunity to play around with flexbox, border properties and plugging in different CSS selectors by specificity to see how CSS functions.

I also learned more about Git and how it works throughout its various stages of cloning in a repo, staging and committing my work with messages before ultimately pushing my project up to Github.
